## Introduction to Decentralized applications(Dapps)

> Decentralized applications (DApps) are software applications that run on a decentralized network, such as the Ethereum blockchain. DApps are built using blockchain technology, which allows them to be distributed and secure. They operate on a peer-to-peer network, rather than being controlled by a single entity, which makes them resistant to censorship and fraud.

> DApps can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, voting systems, and more. They are often open-source and use smart contracts to facilitate the execution of their functions.

To create a DApp, developers can use various programming languages and frameworks, such as Solidity, Truffle, and Web3.js.
